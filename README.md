# inla-sandbox

A collection of notebooks written by [Jeff Eaton](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/jeffrey.eaton) on spatio-temporal modelling with `R-INLA` and `TMB`.
I've rendered and uploaded these for my own reference.
Perhaps they might be useful to you too:

* [arima110-inla-rgeneric](arima110-inla-rgeneric.html): demonstration of the $\text{AR}(1)$ and $\text{ARIMA}(1, 1, 0)$ models using `R-INLA`'s `rgeneric` framework
* [inla-internals](inla-internals.html): understanding internal details of `R-INLA` via experimentation, such as constants added to the diagonal for numerical stability, scaling of precision matrices, and implementation of Kronecker products via the `group` option
* [inla-tmb-constraints](inla-tmb-constraints.html): [to summarise!]
* [tmb-bym2](tmb-bym2.html): efficient implementation of the BYM2 model in `TMB`
